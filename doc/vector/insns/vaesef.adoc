Description:: 
This instruction implements the final-round encryption function of the AES block cipher. The inputs and outputs to this
instruction are comprised of 128-bit element groups.  Each element group of source `vs2` holds the current round state
and each 128-bit element group of `vs2` holds the round key.
In the case of the `.vs` form of the instruction, element group 0 of the single register `vs2` holds a single element group that is used
as the round key for all of the element groups in `vd`. While in this case `vs2` is a single register,
`vd` can be a register group. 
The next round state output of each element group is produced by applying the SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundkey
steps to the corresponding inputs and is written to each `EGW=128` element group of `vd`.

This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not
depend on the data being operated upon.    

* SubBytes(state)
* ShiftRows(state)
* AddRoundKey(state,roundkey)

//(ASIICDOC limitation???: Can't end on a bullet)

Note::
For the `.vs` form, since the least significant element group of register `vs2` is used for all element groups in register groups `vd`
and `vs2`, the destination vector register group cannot overlap with the single `vs` vector register,
otherwise the instruction encoding is reserved.


Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (VAESEF(vs2, vd) = {
  // calculate the number of element groups (eg)
  eg = (vl/EGS)  
  foreach (i from vstart to eg) {
    let state : bits(128) = get_velem(vd, EGW=128, i);
    let rkey  : bits(128) = get_velem(vs2, EGW=128, i);
    let sb    : bits(128) = aes_fwd_sub_bytes(state);
    let sr    : bits(128) = aes_fwd_shift_rows(sb);
    let ark   : bits(128) = sr ^ rkey;
    set_velem(vd, EGW=128, i, ark);
  }
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
